# Carbon-Emissions-Analysis
Examining Carbon Emissions of 15 Countries 

In this project, I take carbon emissions data collected in the last 200 years to analyze emissions information from 15 countries with the highest gross domestic product (GDP). 
Of the 232 countries included in the csv, I chose to evaluate only 15 countries because GDP and carbon emissions have a known positive correlation. Each country in the analysis is given a color and country code to be included in each of the graphs for ease of reading. 

The first graph shows the emissions data of the top 5 highest GDP countries over the entirety of their recorded carbon emissions information. These countries may have started recording information during different years, which is reflected by their varying starting points on the graph.

In the second graph, I take decade samples from 1950 to 2017 (1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2017) to display how carbon emissions have changed over the last 67 years. The tenth country, Russia, did not start recording emissions data until 1959, so the 1950â€™s sample was not included for this country only. Initially, I attempted to take decade averages from 1950-2017. However, upon plotting these averages, I found little variation from decade to decade, increasing only slightly per decade. I chose not to sort the countries on this plot to emphasize the change in emissions per country over these years.

In the third graph, I plot emissions information from the last 5 recorded years (2013-2017). I sorted the countries by their 5-year average in descending order. Even upon altering the scale, the difference per year can be difficult to see; the emissions changed only nominally in the last 5 years. 

In the fourth and fifth graphs, I plot the countries decade information (2010-2017), and sort the countries by highest percent of total emissions from the selected 15 countries. 
These graphs are not representative of total global emissions from this decade. Emissions from the remaining countries are considered statistically insignificant in comparison to the emissions from the highest GDP countries. 


*The purpose of this analysis was to examine carbon emissions from the highest GDP countries and experiment with different graphs and different methods to determine which ways of visualizing the data were most effective, and which were not. This project took me several weeks, as I wanted to experiment with the data to see what worked, what didn't, and how to improve the methods which were less effective.*
